                            We are a society of students at Durham University passionate about all things space. 
                            We aim to provide an environment in which our cohort can develop their interest in space through hands-on projects, concurrent R&D, and networking with industry professionals.
                            Engaging in the local community is an important aspect of shortening the gap between education and careers in the space-sector. 
                            As such we assist a richer STEM education system by bringing the UK Space Design Competition to local schools.

                <p>In June 2020, DUSF successfully launched a high-altitude balloon to the edge of space. The balloon was equipped with a teddy bear pilot, two cameras and solar tracker. It steadily rose to an estimated altitude of 19km
                capturing some incredible images of the Northwest of England and beautiful shots of the horizon with the familiar blue haze that dissipates to the darkness of space.</p>
                <p>Our team worked remotely over the course of the year to research, design and build the balloon payload. Once it became possible to meet in-person, the modular components were assembled to complete the payload. The balloon was inflated with helium at the Physics Department and 
                then launched from Mountjoy Hill on the Science Site. After a flight time of 88 minutes, the payload landed south of Consett, a town just outside of the North Pennines around 19 miles from Durham. All equipment used was then 
                successfully recovered by the team.
                </p> 
                <p>This flight was tracked using a solar Iridium beacon that relayed GPS data and sensor readings to us via the Iridium satellite constellation. This allowed us to follow the balloon in real-time and find it after it had landed.
                    Due to some anomoly mid-flight, the beacon failed to transmit ~10 sequential messages so the maximum altitude reached had to be calculated using predictions from the acquired data and compared to the footage captured.

                <p>The next flight, Aether II, is scheduled for launch in October 2021 and aims to bring improvements to all aspects of the payload. Two additional trackers with data-loggers will be used and an attempt will be made 
                    to release the teddy bear on a skydive from the edge of space!

                <p>Inflated with helium that was generously sponsored by the Physics department, DU Spaceflight society’s second high-altitude balloon project, Aether II, was launched from James' Hill on Thursday, 4 November. </p>
                <p>An enthusiastic team of 15 students witnessed the release of the Helium Latex balloon with great excitement. The giant white sphere was seen to be slowly floating away as a tiny dot and eventually vanishing into the azure sky on the crisp, sunny autumn morning. </p>
                <p>The project spanned over a month during which students met up every Monday to discuss and design the payload, electronics, and mechanical components of the Balloon.  Similar to its predecessor Aether I, Aether II is equipped with a teddy bear photographer/pilot with an addition of two data-log trackers.
               The solar iridium satellite tracker relayed the GPS and sensor data back to the team via the iridium satellite constellation. The balloon spent 2hrs 30min in flight and travelled 177 km. It reached the target altitude of 34km before bursting and landing in the peak district; was eventually retrieved by two team members. 
                </p>
                <p>With the introduction of a stabilisation system, the camera in the payload recorded beautiful high-quality footage of Earth seen from the stratosphere.
